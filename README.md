ðŸš€ New Web Project Completed!
ðŸ›’ Product Filter & Sort Page using HTML, CSS & JavaScript

I recently built an interactive product catalog page that allows users to:

âœ… Filter products by category and price range
âœ… Sort items by price (Low to High / High to Low) or rating
âœ… View a clean, responsive layout with real product images

This project helped me improve my DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design skills.

ðŸ§  Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
ðŸ’» Goal: Enhance user experience through smooth filtering & sorting
